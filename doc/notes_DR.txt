# Notes for codespace ( opened in browser of course ! )

# After enabling the python env :
$ source ../venv3.10.4/bin/activate

# Lauching the project :
$ python -m manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8200

# IT WORKS !!! ( opened port on browser - native = same as codespace start - )
# the link gh codespace gives to it (did you see the space rocket !!!)

# other wise, with ssh X forwarded and good chrome package installed :
# Cf : ../tmp/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
$ google-chrome http://127.0.0.1:8200   ===> WORKS tambien ! LOL

# Config du debug / vscode de codespace
# I missed a point (after initiating my venv in ../venv.10.4)
# ISSUE : didn't configure my interpretor (dunno how to do this...)

# Python module use this default path :
/home/codespace/.python/current

# renamed
/home/codespace/.python/current_MS_shit
# hard linked my venv on it:
ln -s /workspaces/venv3.10.4 /home/codespace/.python/current
# => issue python program is linked on current...
# del link and copy python from current:
rm venv3.10.4/bin/python
p /home/codespace/.python/current_MS_shit/bin/python venv3.10.4/bin/python

# if you ddn't understand above verbose
# don't worry : I didn't either...
# THOUGH : IT WORKS IN DEBUG MODE !!!
# NB : json file is obscure : 
#      cant figure it out for modifying so called ${file}...

# Putting ../sh/ssh-agent.sh commands directly in ~/.bashrc
# => ok push manually from new Terminal
